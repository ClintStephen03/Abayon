		<p>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b style="font-size: 100%;"> Lionel Messi </b> is a soccer player with Paris Saint-Germain and the Argentina national team. He has established records for goals scored and won individual awards en route to worldwide recognition as one of the best players in soccer.</p>
		
<hr>

		<h1> Who is Lionel Messi? </h1> 



		<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Luis Lionel Andres .<strong>(“Leo”) </strong>	 Messi is an Argentinian soccer player who plays forward for the FC Barcelona club and the Argentina national team. At the age of 13, Messi moved from Argentina to Spain after FC Barcelona agreed to pay for his medical treatments. 

		 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There he earned renown as one of the greatest players in history, helping his club win more than two dozen league titles and tournaments. In 2012, he set a record for most goals in a calendar year, and in 2019, he was named Europe's Ballon d'Or winner for the sixth time.</p>

<hr>


		<h1> Early Life </h1>

		
		
		<p>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Messi was born on <b style="font-size: 100%;"> June 24, 1987 </b>, in Rosario, Argentina. As a young boy, Messi tagged along when his two older brothers played soccer with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger boys. At the age of 8, he was recruited to join the youth system of Newell's Old Boys, a Rosario-based club. <p/>
		<p> <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Recognizably smaller than most of the kids in his age group, Messi was eventually diagnosed by doctors as suffering 	from a hormone deficiency that restricted his growth. Messi's parents,<b style="font-size: 100%;"> Jorge and Ceclia,</b> decided on a regimen of nightly growth-hormone injections for their son, though it soon proved impossible to pay several hundred dollars per month for the medication. 
		So, at the age of 13, when Messi was offered the chance to train at soccer powerhouse FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, and have his medical bills covered by the team, Messi's family picked up and moved across the Atlantic to make a new home in Spain. Although he was often homesick in his new country, Messi moved quickly through the junior system ranks.<br/><p/>

			<p><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ultimately, Messi's short stature (5 feet, 7 inches), combined with his speed and relentless attacking style, has drawn comparisons to another famous Argentinian footballer, <b style="font-size: 100%;"> Diego Maradon	</b> </p>

<hr>

		<h1> Soccer Career and Teams </h1>

			<p> <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp By the age of 16, <b style="font-size: 100%;"> Messi made his first appearance for the FC Barcelona, putting himself in the record books on May 1, 2005, as the youngest player to ever score a goal for the franchise.</b> That same year, he led Argentina to the title in the under-20 World Cup, scoring on a pair of penalty kicks to propel the team over Nigeria.<br/> <p>

			<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Messi steered Barcelona to a wealth of success, most notably in 2009, when the left-footer's team captured the Champions League, La Liga, and Spanish Super Cup titles. That same year, after two consecutive runner-up finishes, he took home his first FIFA <b style="font-size: 100%;"> "World Player of the Year" </b>honor/Ballon d'Or award.<p/>

			<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Even the great Maradona gushed about his fellow countryman. "I see him as very similar to me," the retired player told the BBC. <b style="font-size: 100%;">"He's a leader and is offering lessons in beautiful football. He has something different than any other player in the world.</b></p>
